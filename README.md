# ðŸ’® kawaii counter
a generator for making 88x31 hit counters, perfect for use on neocities, nekoweb, and other web revival projects.

i made this in a day because the site i used to use, cutercounters, was dead.

### features
 - multiple layouts
 - font selection
 - custom colors
 - borders
 - custom backgrounds

### selfhosting

feel free to fork and self host your own instance if you want your counter off my server! just make sure to reset the counters.json file and remove the backgrounds if you don't want the preexisting counters on your instance. 

then, you can just host the server.js file with your chosen method. i personally just open a server with `node server.js 3000` and tunnel to it through `cloudflared`

i'm currently hosting the public version over at https://kawaiicounter.com on a server i constructed entirely out of ewaste. it's really bad.
